### Grid (Commented Out)

## JavaScript Files
The functionality of this HTML structure is powered by three JavaScript files:

- `options.js`: Contains functions for handling menu options.
- `script.js`: Handles general spreadsheet interactions.
- `function.js`: Manages spreadsheet functions and calculations.

Please note that the actual functionality of the spreadsheet is driven by these JavaScript files and is not described in detail in this README.

Feel free to further customize, enhance, and expand upon this HTML structure to create a fully functional Google Sheets clone.
